## How to Run

To run this game, simply open the index.html file located in this directory. The game should run on any modern web browser that supports ES6. It has not been tested on older browsers that do not support ES6

## How to Play

The game will begin as soon as the html file loads. The goal is to reach the water on the top. If you touch one of the bugs crossing the stone road, you will lose and have to start over.

Reaching the water will also reset the game.

## Next Steps

I need to improve on the winning and losing scenarios for example: adding a winning modal, or having a lives system and an indicator whenever a player loses a life.

I would like to add some functionality like having the player select their own avatar sprite, as well as place extra items that the player can collect. In addition, a points system would be nice to keep track of how well a player does.

A "Start Game" Button.
